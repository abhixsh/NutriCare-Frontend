To make Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, start by preparing 1 pound of large shrimp by peeling and deveining them. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add two minced garlic cloves and a tablespoon of minced ginger, sautéing them for about a minute until fragrant. Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook them until they turn pink and opaque, which should take about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set them aside. In the same skillet, add a diced red bell pepper, a julienned small carrot, and a cup of shredded cabbage. Cook these vegetables for about 3-4 minutes until they are tender yet still crisp. While the vegetables are cooking, prepare the sauce by whisking together 1/4 cup of soy sauce, a tablespoon of hoisin sauce, a tablespoon of rice vinegar, a teaspoon of sesame oil, and, if you prefer some heat, a tablespoon of sriracha. <br/> <br/>Return the shrimp to the skillet with the vegetables and pour the sauce over everything, stirring to ensure an even coating. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the shrimp and vegetables are well combined and heated through. To assemble the lettuce wraps, take a head of butter or iceberg lettuce and separate the leaves. Place a generous spoonful of the shrimp and vegetable mixture into the center of each lettuce leaf. Top with thinly sliced green onions, chopped fresh cilantro, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds if desired. Serve the lettuce wraps immediately, either on their own or with a side of your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy the fresh, flavorful combination of tender shrimp and crisp vegetables wrapped in refreshing lettuce leaves!</p>
